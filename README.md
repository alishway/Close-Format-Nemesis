Close-Format-Nemesis
====================

This repository is where I keep the file requirements for building a predictive text app with Coursera and SwiftKey. It is also where I keep the graphs from the reports, where I will post the codes that worked, and my process. The repository will have a Master branch and a Project branch. I will be able to create a static page on the web to showcase the project. All submissions will be prepared according to the requirements set for the Capstone Project.
