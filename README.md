Close-Format-Nemesis
====================

This repository is where I keep the file requirements for building a predictive text app with Coursera and SwiftKey. It is also where I keep the graphs from the reports, where I will post the codes that worked, and my process. The repository will have a Master branch and a Project branch. I will be able to create a static page on the web to showcase the project. All submissions will be prepared in order to perform the set of analysis in the Capstone Project. 

## Folder and file structure

- **assignment**/ *where I keep the assignments*
- **code**/ *where I keep the raw code & the final code for each assignment*
- **data**/ *stores the data*
- **figures**/ *stores the final figures*
- **writing**/ *keeps the final analysis* 

## Assignment

There are five major types of assignments involved in this project. An introductory quiz to test whether I have downloaded and can manipulate the data. An intermediate R markdown report that describes in plain language, plots, and code the exploratory analysis of the course dataset. Two natural language processing quizzes, where I apply my predictive model to real data to check how it is working. A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words), one clicks submit, and it predicts the next word. A 5-slide deck created with R presentations pitching my algorithm and app to my bosses and/or investors.

## Code

The codes are prepared according to the guidelines set out by the Coursera team. Spacing is a minimum of 8 spaces from the left. Other than using GitHub, I don't have any other code sharing plans. These codes will be reproducible, but they might not reproduce exactly the results presented here. When structuring the codes in the code files, I annotate them so that I could identify what I'm planning to be doing with the codes. For example: *setting work directory*, *getting work directory*, *listing files inside folder*, *dowloading files*, etc. I plan to make both the Raw code and the Final code accessible for the final project. I might "comment out" the codes.

## Data

The data comes in the form of very large text files. To process them, the project makes use of:

- [Natural Language Processing](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/NaturalLanguageProcessing.html)
- the infrastructure laid out in [CRUNCH](http://crunch.kmi.open.ac.uk/w/index.php/Tutorial) and its tutorials
- the accompanying website to the Speech and Language Processing handbook
- the companying website to Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing
- NLP Stanford course [lectures](https://www.coursera.org/course/nlp) 

## Figures

I store all the figures generated for the purpose of completing and revising the Milestone report and the Final report here in this folder. There should be a set of Final Figures for the Final report, if not impossible. The naming of the figures are as such to help me make sense of neat, tidy filed visual explorations. The codes that generated the figures will be made available in the Code folder. 

## Writing

This is where the final report should be placed.
