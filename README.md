Close-Format-Nemesis
====================

This repository is where I keep the file requirements for building a predictive text app with Coursera and SwiftKey. It is also where I keep the graphs from the reports, where I will post the codes that worked, and my process. The repository will have a Master branch and a Project branch. I will be able to create a static page on the web to showcase the project. All submissions will be prepared in order to perform the set of analysis in the Capstone Project. 

## Folder and file structure
=========================

- **assignment** is where I keep my assignments
- **code** is where I keep the raw code & the final code for each assignment
- **data** stores the data
- **figures** stores the final figures
- **writing** keeps the final analysis
