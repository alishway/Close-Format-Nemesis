Close-Format-Nemesis
====================

This repository is where I keep the file requirements for building a predictive text app with Coursera and SwiftKey. It is also where I keep the graphs from the reports, where I will post the codes that worked, and my process. The repository will have a Master branch and a Project branch. I will be able to create a static page on the web to showcase the project. All submissions will be prepared in order to perform the set of analysis in the Capstone Project.

- **assignment**/ *where I keep the assignments*
- **code**/ *where I keep the raw code & the final code for each assignment*
- **data**/ *stores the data*
- **figures**/ *stores the final figures*
- **writing**/ *keeps the final analysis* 

## Assignment

There are five major types of assignments involved in this project. An introductory quiz to test whether I have downloaded and can manipulate the data. An intermediate R markdown report that describes in plain language, plots, and code the exploratory analysis of the course dataset. Two natural language processing quizzes, where I apply my predictive odel to real data to check how it is working. A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words), one clicks submit, and it predicts the next word. A 5-slide deck created with R presentations pitching my algorithm and app to my bosses and/or investors.

## Code

The codes are prepared according to the guidelines set out by the Coursera team. Spacing is a minimum of 8 spaces from the left. Other than using GitHub, I don't have any other code sharing plans. These codes will be reproducible, but they might not reproduce exactly the results presented here. When structuring the codes in the code files, I annotate them so that I could identify what I'm actually doing with the codes. For example: setting work directory, getting work directory, listing files inside folder, dowloading files, etc. I plan to make both the Raw code and the Final code accessible for the final project.
